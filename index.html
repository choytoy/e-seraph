                Before selecting a paradigm, take a moment to feel the extremities of your body, and the orientation of
                your limbs in space. Notice any distractions around you, and permit them to wash over you like waves.
                In this moment, as with all moments in life, you are not an immovable stone. You are a reed that
                bends to the current but does not break. When you are ready, you may close your eyes and contemplate
                an issue or a topic of signficiance to you. To derive meaning from your reading, it is crucial to grasp
                a specific question or idea.

                    future.
