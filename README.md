=======================================================
Welcome to the e-Seraph Oracle Deck, a small custom oracle deck by Choy.
I made this deck as a small meditation tool, to inspire self-reflection.

1. What is an oracle deck?
-An oracle deck is a deck of divination cards similar to a traditional tarot deck, but without a set structure or suits.

2. Is an oracle deck used for divination/fortune-telling?
-It depends on the user. Personally, I do not use oracle decks for divination. Rather, I use oracle decks for mindfulness.
-By drawing cards, I am prompted by their corresponding symbolism to reflect on a question.
-This helps me to consider new solutions, reflect on my behaviour and habits, and set goals.
-In a way, the cards serve as more of a guide to my internal thoughts and processing.

3. How do I use the e-Seraph Oracle Deck?
-Begin by reflecting on a question. For example, are you having mixed feelings about an interpersonal issue, artist's block,
or a life change?
-Then select a paradigm that best addresses how you'd like to reflect on this question:
a. Solo - 1 Card spread: This paradigm will prompt you to select a single card, for quick reflections or simple meditation.
b. Chrono - 3 Card Spread: This paradigm will have you select 3 cards. One will represent lessons from your past, one will represent the present question at hand, and the last will represent things to consider for the future.
c. Fork - 2 Card Spread: This paradigm will have you select 2 cards. Each card will represent a separate consideration for you to contemplate when addressing your question. Choose the one that resonates most with you.
-Once you have chosen your spread, you will be prompted to choose face-down cards. They will be flipped over to reveal their meaning.
-Read the corresponding guide, and take notes if you wish. The cards can be used as journaling prompts, for example.

4. Are inverted cards bad?
-No cards are *bad* per say. Each card holds specific symbolism, it's up to you to consider how that symbolism is meaningful to you.
-An inverted card usually signifies an opposing force to the card's symbolism. For example, a card that symbolises community might prompt you to consider your social circle when taking action on your question. An inverted version of that same card could represent individuality, and might prompt you to prioritize yourself in upcoming decisions.

5. I pulled "X" card and now I'm worried about the implications!
-The cards do not predict or manifest the future, they only call your attention to elements of symbolism. It's hand-drawn art generated on Procreate and uploaded to a Git repository. You will be okay, and if you're not -- don't blame the cards. ♡
